# Overview

In this workshop we will continue our examination of ANOVA. Specifically, we will focus on ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) before exploring how AN(C)OVA is a special case of regression and how both can be understood in the context of the General Linear Model.

# Building our ANCOVA

Let's run through the ANCOVA example that I cover in the video above. First we need to load the packages we need. We'll be using the `tidyverse` for general data wrangling and data visualisation, and then the `afex` package for building our ANCOVA model, and the `emmeans` package for running pairwise comparisons and displaying our adjusted means.  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # Load the tidyverse packages
library(afex) # ANOVA functions
library(emmeans) # Needed for pairwise comparisons
```
